// Examples of static assets includes: image files, styles file, and also Javascript files
// (Those JS files that doesn't change regardless of the visitor). 
// All static resources are dumped in a folder commonly called "public". 
// This is where all static resources should go.
// Using this method, express takes care of the status codes, content type, file path, etc automatically for us.

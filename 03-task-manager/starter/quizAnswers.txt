    1. How to get your app to access the informatiom in the .env file.

     To get your app to access the information in the .env file:
     First, require the dotenv package and invoke the config() method alongside using:
      "require("dotenv").config();".
     Then use "process.env.<variableName>" to access it wherever needed in the code block.

    2. How you protect the content of the .env file.

     This is done by gitignoring the .env file. To do this, type in .env in the
     .gitignore file as one of the files/folders to be ignored. In practice, the moment 
     one sets up the .env file, one should immediately set up the .gitignore file as well
     and include the .env file in the .gitignore file. This is how you protect your .env
     file content.
